# Music Genre Classifier with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project implements a Music Genre Classifier using Deep Learning techniques in Java. The classifier is trained on audio features extracted from music tracks to predict their genre. Deep Learning is leveraged to automatically learn relevant patterns and features from the audio data for accurate classification.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Utilizes a CNN architecture to learn hierarchical representations of audio features.
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset:** Demonstrates training and evaluation using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Custom datasets can be used for music genre classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluates the classifier's performance using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Persistence:** Saves the trained model to disk for future use or deployment in production environments.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/music-genre-classifier-with-deep-learning.git>
    
    ```
    
2. **Compile and Run:**
    
    ```bash
    cd music-genre-classifier-with-deep-learning
    javac MusicGenreClassifier.java
    java MusicGenreClassifier
    
    ```
    
3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
    
    Follow the prompts to train the classifier and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.
    

## Usage

1. **Train the Classifier:**
    
    Train the classifier on a dataset of music audio features and corresponding genre labels. Adjust hyperparameters and network architecture as needed.
    
2. **Evaluate Performance:**
    
    Evaluate the classifier's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset.
    
3. **Save the Model:**
    
    Save the trained model to disk for future use or deployment in production environments.
